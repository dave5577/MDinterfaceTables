# MDinterfaceTables
# Using MarkDown to create interface tables


## Objectives

* The first test will be to show it is possible to quickly draw up tables to present interfaces by system or subsystem.

* The next step will be to show linking (using hyperlinks within the MD script) for both sides of each interface.


An example table is shown below -


First Header | Second Header
------------ | -------------
Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2
Content in the first column | Content in the second column
